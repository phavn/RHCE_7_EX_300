	- System performance related files are in /proc

	- Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat. Dstat overcomes some of the limitations and adds some extra features.

	- Install sysstat package for historical system usage
	- sadf - The  sadf command is used for displaying the contents of data files created by the sar(1) command. But unlike sar, sadf can write its data in many different formats (CSV, XML, etc.)


	- Config file location
		- /etc/sysconfig/sysstat 
	- Get reports from 12:00 to 23:59:59 and store it to /root/report
		# sadf -s 12:00:00 -e 23:59:59 /var/log/sa/sa15 > /root/report
	- Output: 
		-x for XML format
		-d for comma delimited format
	- Time is displayed in UTC by default
		-T - output in local system time
	- By default sadf pulls out all information, however we can use ‐‐ to specify sar commands, such as -u for cpu, -r for memory, or -d for disk activity.
		# sadf /var/log/sa/sa22 -- -r
