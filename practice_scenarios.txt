- Test stuff

	- Host and user based security for all services, bind to specific interface or ip address
		- iscsi
		- httpd
		- mysql
		- postfix
		- nfs
	- Memorize json syntax for activebackup network teaming runner
	- Set up ssl for main apache documentroot
	- Practise creating directories in main apache folder - then changing ownership to a regular user to it can be accesses as rw locally (I think)
	- Set up NFS with kerberos using premade keytab files
	- Practise setting up mysql user (Had issue logging in)
	- Practise SQL joins and where clause
	- Why did I get 0 on smtp?
	- Why didn't ipv6 configuration work? it was d000:a18::d5 and d000:a18::d0
	- Why was RedHat 7.0 used?
