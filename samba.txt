##### SAMBA #####


	- Samba Global Parameters

		Samba Parameter 			Use
		workgroup			Specifies the Windows workgroup that the Samba server is a member of. This setting is also used to specify the Samba domain. 
		security 			Indicates how security is handled. The default is set to security =	user , which requires users to have a valid username that is managed by the Samba server and mapped 					 to a Linux user account name.
		host allow 			A comma, space, or tab-delimited list of hosts that are allowed access to the Samba service. See man 5 hosts_access for details on the
							 format that needs to be used.
		load printers 		This option, which by default is set to yes, ensures that printers from the CUPS print subsystem are shared through Samba.
		cups options 		This option is used to specify that print driver processing is handled by CUPS and at the Samba level no interpretation of print jobs has
							 to happen.
		log file 			Specifies the name of the file that Samba writes log messages to.


	- Common Directory Share Options

		Directive 						Use
		path					The path on the Linux file system of the shared directory. 
		writable 				Enables write access on a share. If set to yes, all authenticated users have write access (if also permitted by Linux permissions). If set to no, a comma-separated 						 write list of users or groups can be used to specify names of users and groups that have write permissions on the share. (See also read only.)
		read only				Setting the read only parameter to no has the same effect as setting writable to yes.
		write list 				Contains a comma separated list of users or groups that have write access, even if writable is set to no. To use groups, put a @ or + in front of the
		group name.
		valid users 			Use to limit access to the share to listed users only. By default all users have access to the share.
		comment 				Use to specify a comment. This comment is displayed to users before connecting to the share.
		guest ok 				Allows access to the guest account. Be careful using this, because it basically bypasses all security settings. This parameter is required on some administrative 							 shares though.
		browseable 				Allows browse access to shares, which means that users can navigate through the share structure to see items available in the share. Make sure to
								 disable on the [home] share.

	- Create samba users

		1. Add linux user
			# useradd -s /sbin/nologin joe
		2. Add samba user account 
			# smbpasswd -a joe


	# Samba server configuration

		- Install packages
			# yum install samba samba-client cifs-utils
		- Add bunch of user accounts using useradd and smbpasswd
			# useradd -s /sbin/nologin joe
			# smbpasswd -a joe
		- Add users to common group (create it first obviously)
			# groupadd sambagroup
			# usermod -G sambagroup joe
		- Create samba share directory
			# mkdir /sambashare
			# chgrp sambagroup /sambashare
			# chmod 770 /sambashare
			# chmod g+s /sambashare
		- Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf; Add
			[sambashare]
				comment = My Samba Share
				path = /sambashare
				write list = @sambagroup
		- Test config syntax
			# testparm
		- Enable and start service
			# systemctl enable smb
			# systemctl start smb
		- Verify that share is available
			# smbclient -L localhost
		- SELinux
		- Firewall
		- Mount
			# mount -t cifs -o user=joe -o password=joe //smbserver/sambashare /mnt/sambashare
